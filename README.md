# TicTacToe-WiiU
This is meant to be played on a WiiU using the [Homebrew Launcher](https://gbatemp.net/threads/homebrew-launcher-for-wiiu.416905/).

**This fork adds an AI player to be `O`.** The player is almost as bad as the code used to make it.

### Usage
If you want to use this (you probably don't), add a folder in `[SD_CARD]/wiiu/apps/` called `tic_tac_toe` (or whatever you want; it really doesn't matter). Then copy [tictactoe.elf](https://github.com/PullJosh/TicTacToe-WiiU/blob/master/tictactoe.elf) into that folder. The game will then appear in the Homebrew Launcher.
